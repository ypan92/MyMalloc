Special Instructions:
    My Makefile is the one provided in the spec that is used
    by the provided test harness. It creates it using make intel-all
    (which can also just be run as make) which will create the 32 bit
    and 64 bit versions of malloc.o as well as the .so libraries for each 

Misc Info:
    Address spaces need to be divisible by 16. To be safe, I aligned the 
    block headers as well as their content to these divisible by 16
    addresses.
    Also, I wasn't too sure about the DEBUG_MALLOC output values.
    For example, for malloc it would be 
    "MALLOC: malloc(%d) => (ptr=%p, size=%d)"
    For this instance I just made the first %d the size value passes to
    malloc. Then the %p would be the address returned by malloc and the
    final %d would be the size field of the header of the block returned.
